# acoustic1d

This is a 1D acoustic wave FWI program I wrote as practice when I was reading the book [Full Seismic Waveform Modelling and Inversion](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642158063). The code is a bit messy, but works pretty well. Although 1D acoustic FWI doesn't seem to have any practical uses, some of the results can be a useful reference on the improvement of convergence of an inversion.
